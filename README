DESCRIPTION
 A preprocessor that lets you use ruby to inline code-generation in
 other source files. Output can be saved (e.g. to hide the intermediary
 layer from someone who doesn't care for ruby), or can be piped directly
 to a compiler/interpreter. I'd like to add something to let people use
 this in shebangs eventually. Enjoy playing with it!
