I think I fixed this 06/04/2010

See below:
  * about to process ./rbc
    >> generation ./rbc -> . complete.
  * about to process ./rbc/examples/test.cc.rbc
    >> generation ./rbc/examples/test.cc.rbc -> ./rbc/examples/test.cc complete.

Basically, it needs to only operate on actual files, and only things that end in \.rbc, not just .rbc (regex .)
